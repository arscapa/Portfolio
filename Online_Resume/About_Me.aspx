                <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>Throughout the years, I have developed and pursued a wide variety of interests, however, I have always maintained a love for programming and developing websites and applications. My interest
                in web development all began back in grade school when I realized by copying all of the HTML code on a web page I could mirror 
                familiar web pages. Being somewhat of a prankster, I decided to put this new-found knowledge to use one particular April Fools Day.
                By changing all the links on an email login screen, I was able to redirect the user (my parents in this case) to a page of my choosing
                and trick them into thinking they had done irreperable damage to their computer. Sadly, my parents didn't find this prank quite 
                as amusing as I did! But it was from here my interest in programming and web development really took off as I realized I could develop my own web
                pages with just a little bit of HTML and CSS. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I carried this interest in web development through to high school taking all the web development classes that were available to me. However, after moving
                 on to college I began to pursue an education in Business and Accounting and web development took a back seat until my last few
                 years of college when I decided to add Business Information Systems as a second major. It was through this decision that I once again 
                realized the passion I have for web development and I created this website to bolster my skills and showcase this passion.
