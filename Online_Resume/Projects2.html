            <h3>Raspberry Pi 3</h3>
            <p>
                With the intention of learning Linux as well as improving my programming and hardware/software skills I recently built and configured a Raspberry Pi and
                I have since utilized/configured the Pi for the following;
                <ul>
                    <li>Network Attached Storage Device (NAS) </li>
                    <li>Media Server running Plex and Kodi</li>
                    <li>Retropie retro-gaming maching running all my favorite classic games </li>
                    <li>Setting up the Pi as a Virtual Private Network Server (VPN)</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>Using a combination of VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Macro's, & VBA coding, I was able to take an outstanding check reconciliation that was previously performed manually and decrease the lead time from several hours to mere minutes.

            <h3>Zendesk</h3>
            <p>
                For my capstone BIS class, I worked with ISU's College of Business to develop a solution for their support staff to more efficiently handle the technical needs and issues of the college. We ultimately
                recommended a software-as-a-service solution called Zendesk because of it's proven track record and scalability. For more information on this project, including a feasibility analysis, prototype ERD's, success metrics, & a requirements document, click <a href="ProjectFiles.zip">here</a> to download some of our project files.
