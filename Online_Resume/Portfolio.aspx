     <h3>Excel Spreadsheet Application</h3>
         <p>Using a combination of VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Macro's, & VBA coding, I was able to take an outstanding check reconciliation that was previously performed manually and decrease the lead time from several hours to mere minutes.

         <h3>Zendesk</h3>
<p>For my capstone BIS class, I worked with the ISU State Farm Hall of Business to develop a solution for their support staff to more efficiently handle requests for assistance. We ultimately
    recommended a software-as-a-service solution called Zendesk because of it's proven track record and scalability. For more information on this project click here to download some of our project files.
