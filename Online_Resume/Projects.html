                <p>
                   Utilizing Spotify's API, I created a game where you can test how well you know your favorite artists by trying to 
                    guess their songs based on a small sample audio clip. Click here to prove how well you know your favorite band!

                <p>
                    In my free time I've been working on restoring a 1974 Dodge Charger and I wanted to create
                    a place where I could show people all the work I've done on the car. I also wanted a unique way to organize
                    the images so I created an interactive image gallery. <b>
                        Click the picture on the left to see
                        the image gallery in action!

                <h3>Automated Server Backup Script </h3>
                <p>
                 While transitioning into a new role within my organization I identified an opportunity to automate the daily backup of files from a UNIX server which was being completed manually. Utilizing WinSCP, SFTP, & Windows Task Scheduler, I was able to write a batch script
                 to pull files from a server and compress and archive these files to a local network drive at a prescribed time while also performing some data validation checks on the files.   
                The process improvement helped to significantly reduce inherent risk in the process related to human error and will result in an estimated 65 hours of time savings per year (15mins/day X 261 working days).
