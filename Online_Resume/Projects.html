                <p>Using a combination of VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Macro's, & VBA coding, I was able to take an outstanding check reconciliation that was previously performed manually and decrease the lead time from several hours to mere minutes. Click the pic above for a quick demo of the application in action </p>

                <h3>Zendesk</h3>
                <p>
                    For my capstone BIS class, I worked with ISU's College of Business to develop a solution for their support staff to more efficiently handle the technical needs and issues of the college. We ultimately
                    recommended a software-as-a-service solution called Zendesk because of it's proven track record and scalability.

                <h3>Interactive Image Gallery</h3>
                <p>In my free time I've been working on restoring a 1974 Dodge Charger and in doing so I wanted to create
                a place where I could show people all the work I've done on the car. I also wanted a unique way to organize
                the images so I came up with an idea for an interactive image gallery. Click the picture on the left to see
                the image gallery in action! My initial idea was for an online repair manual where you
                could click sections of the car to get advice and repair diagrams relevant to that section of your car but
                I then morphed this idea into an image gallery to hold all of my car restoration pictures.
