                <p>Using a combination of VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Macro's, & VBA coding, I was able to take an outstanding check reconciliation that was previously performed manually and decrease the lead time from several hours to mere minutes. Click the pic above for a quick demo of the application in action </p>

                <h3>Zendesk</h3>
                <p>
                    For my capstone BIS class, I worked with ISU's College of Business to develop a solution for their support staff to more efficiently handle the technical needs and issues of the college. We ultimately
                    recommended a software-as-a-service solution called Zendesk because of it's proven track record and scalability. For more information on this project, including a feasibility analysis, prototype ERD's, success metrics, & a requirements document, click <a href="ProjectFiles.zip">here</a> to download some of our project files.
