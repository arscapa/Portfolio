                    Utilizing Spotify's API and OAuth User Authentication flow, I created a game where you can test how well you know your favorite artists by trying to
                    guess their songs based on a small sample audio clip. Click here to prove how well you know your favorite band!

                <h3>Interactive Image Gallery</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project I created an interactive image gallery to share with
                    people my progress towards restoring a 1974 Dodge Charger.
                    Technologies utilized include Image Mapping, a Lightbox Image Viewer, and jQuery.

                <h3>Automated Server Backup Script </h3>
                <p>
                    Recently identified an opportunity to automate the daily backup of files from a UNIX server which was being completed manually within my organization. I was able to write a batch script
                    to pull files from the server, compress and archive these files at a scheduled time, while also performing some data validation checks on the files.
                    This improvement significantly reduced inherent risk in the process and will result in an estimated 65 hours of time savings per year (15mins/day X 261 working days). Implemented utilizing WinSCP, SFTP, 7-Zip, Windows Task Scheduler, Batch Scripts, and Python coding.
