                   Utilizing Spotify's API, I created a game where you can test how well you know your favorite artists by trying to 
                    guess their songs based on a small sample audio clip. Click here to prove how well you know your favorite band!

                <p>
                    In my free time I've been working on restoring a 1974 Dodge Charger and I wanted to create
                    a place where I could show people all the work I've done on the car. I also wanted a unique way to organize
                    the images so I created an interactive image gallery. <b>

                        the image gallery in action!

                <p>
                    I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi 3 to work on my programming and hardware/software skills. I've since completed a number of projects using the Pi for the following;
                    <ul>
                        <li>Network Attached Storage Device (NAS) </li>
                        <li>Media Server</li>
                        <li>Retropie retro-gaming maching running all my favorite classic games </li>
                        <li>Setting up the Pi as a Virtual Private Network Server (VPN)</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Using a combination of VLookup, Conditional Formatting, Macro's, & VBA coding, I was able to take an outstanding check reconciliation that was previously performed manually and decrease the lead time from several hours to mere minutes.

                <h3>Zendesk</h3>
                <p>
                    For my capstone BIS class, I worked with ISU's College of Business to develop a solution for their support staff to more efficiently handle the technical needs and issues of the college. We ultimately
                    recommended a software-as-a-service solution called Zendesk because of it's proven track record and scalability.
